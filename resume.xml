    <about>
        <p>
            I am the Unicode support testing phrase with more than 20 years of experience in global international technology companies as well as small startups and flexible teams. I am well recognized by the Czech developers as I contain more diacritic characters than any comparable phrase. My strenghts are user friendliness, beeing cute (who would not like yelowish horse?) and beeing able to spot mistakes in Unicode character handling.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am not looking for the job as I am widelly deployed in many source codes all around the world.
